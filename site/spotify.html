		<h1>It's no secret that I'm a massive fan of music.</h1>
		<p>In fact, I have personally made 148 playlists (as of March 2024)
		<br>However, I do have some playlists that get more attention than others, these special playlists get custom photos, thoughtful names, and the occasional description.
		<br>I make sure to position each song correctly, so that the crossfade sounds as smooth as possible, given one would use such feature.
		<br>And of course I make sure that these playlists only consists of absolute bangers in their own genres!</p>
