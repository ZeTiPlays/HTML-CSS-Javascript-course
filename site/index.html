	<h1>Hello someone!</h1>
	<section>
		Day 1
		<p>I've just learned to make a GitHub website
		<br>Now I'm testing the speed of browser sync.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		Day 2
		<p>I didn't do the course for 2 days, not sure why.
		<br>Today I'm learning about HTML5 Tags, which I'm currently using.
		<br>At this moment I'm learning about lists, there's two types</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Unordered lists(&lt;ul&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;)</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Useful for like a shopping list</li>
						<li>Good for general display</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Ordered lists(&lt;ol&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;)</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Useful for example guides</li>
						<li>Displays list in order, like 1..,2..,3..</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>
		<p>I wonder what else I'll be learning today, I'd like to learn how to space out my site</p>
		<div>Okay so now I'm leaning about links, I'll try to make an internal link, that links to external links.</div>
		<a href="spotify.html" title="Spotify links">
			<div>Here's a list of my favorite Spotify playlists</div></a>
		<p>Now that I've learned how to do links, I've moved on to learning about displaying images
		<br>Obviously this is a big deal, because I actually had a thought about making a paint drawing of what the site should look like
		<br>So while I have yet to learn CSS, here's a paint.exe picture that I spent a super duper very long time on making.<img src="WebsiteDream.png" width="1177" height="619" alt="Horrible paint.exe created picture of my ideal website"></p>
		<p>I've now finished the HTML section of my course, on to CSS! :D</p>
		<div>I added a font (not part of the course, at least not yet, figured it out myself) and changed the &quot;h1&quot; to look super cool!</div>
